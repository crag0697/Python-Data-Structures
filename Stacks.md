# Stacks

## Overview

List or arrays are a feature of all programming languages. Their usefulness allows us to apply them in a number of unique ways. The Stack is an application of Python lists characterized by the order that elements are added or removed.

## Key Terms

- Stack: A data structure which is dependent on the order in which elements are added or removed with the Last In, First Out rule.
- LIFO: Last In, First Out. Items entered last in the list are the first to be removed.
- Front: The first index of the stack, most often index 0.
- Back: Then end of a Stack where push and pop operations are performed.
- Push: An operation that adds a new item onto the back of the stack
- Pop: An operation that removes an existing item from the back of a stack

## Stacks in the Real World

It is almost certain that you have interacted with stacks in the real world during day-to-day activities. 

### Dishes

Consider when you would put away dishes in the cupboards. Each time you stack a plate or bowl in the cupboard, you are performing what we would term a **PUSH** operation. Once the dishes are all put away, we can realize that the dishes must be 
removed from the top first in order to get to the first one you put down. Of course, for this example the bottom of the stack would be the front and the top would be the back of the stack. When you go to set out the dishes again, you are executing a **POP** operation by removing
the plates one by one from the top of the stack. Removing from the middle of the stack would be more difficult in this example and we wouldn't pull from the middle of a python stack either. All operations are performed from the back of the stack.
