# Python Data Structures

Welcome to Python Data Structures.  Understanding different kinds of data structures is essential when programming with Python:

- [Stacks](Stacks.md)
- [Sets](Sets.md)
- [Trees](Trees.md)

Each module will cover all aspects of the data structure.  At the end of each module, there will be an example problem followed by a problem for you to try.  Avoid lookign at the solution until you have attempted the problem yourself.
